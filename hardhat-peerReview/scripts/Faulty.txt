Fault Codes
0 : Review appears to be honest and attentive
1 : Bad faith review
2 : Inattentive review (will have reasons within, merged for simplicity for now)
3 : Too short to be meaningful

Replace the numbers in "reason" with strings containing these words,
probably will be handled in the frontend
